Today, we have the pleasure to announce Stockfish 17.1. As always, you can **freely** download it at [stockfishchess.org/download][1] and use it in the [GUI of your choice][2].

Join our [Discord server][3] to get in touch with the community of developers and users of the project!

## Quality of chess play

In our testing against its predecessor, Stockfish 17.1 shows a consistent improvement in performance, with an [Elo gain of up to 20 points][4] and winning close to 2 times more game pairs than it loses.

## Update highlights

### New speedtest command

The new `speedtest` command benchmarks your computer's performance (measured in nodes per second) using a realistic and stable test. To run it, you'll need [command line access][5]—give it a try and share your results with the community!

### Improved hardware support

Stockfish is [no longer limited to 1024 threads][6] and will allow users to specify whatever their system is capable of. Additionally, hardware such as ppc64 and Loongson is now better supported at build time.

### Bug fixes for tablebase support

Our previous release introduced improved engine lines (principal variations) ending in mate as soon as a mate score is announced. A side effect of this improvement was a [rare corner case][7] involving cursed tablebase wins, only relevant in correspondence chess when the 50-move rule does not apply,  which has now been fixed. Relatedly, [time management][8] has also been improved to avoid potential time losses.

## Shoutouts

### Download page redesign

We've redesigned the [download page][1] to address unclear wording and simplify a previously cluttered experience. The page now features a modernized layout, streamlined navigation, and clearer guidance to help you select the right binary for your system.

### Fishtest framework

Our testing framework has been improved in various ways, both on the worker side, including the adoption of [Fastchess][9] as a new game manager, and on the server side, such as streamlined configuration. The reliable availability of testing resources is key for the progress of the engine.

## Thank you

The Stockfish project builds on a thriving community of enthusiasts (thanks everybody!) who contribute their expertise, time, and resources to build a free and open-source chess engine that is robust, widely available, and very strong.

We would like to express our gratitude for the [12k stars][10] that light up our GitHub project! Thank you for your support and encouragement – your recognition means a lot to us.

We invite our chess fans to [join the Fishtest testing framework][11] to contribute compute resources needed for development. Programmers can contribute to the project either directly to [Stockfish][12] (C++), to [Fishtest][13] (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python), to our trainer [nnue-pytorch][14] (C++ and Python), or to our [website][15] (HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript).
